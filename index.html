				<h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
				<!-- your work experience -->
				<h3>SOFTWARE ENGINEER</h3>
				<p>
						Megatronix | May 2023-Present
				</p>
				<p>
						<!--Describe what you did in this position with one summary sentence and no more than 3 bullet points with specific highlights-->
						Systems Engineering Intern
				</p>
				<ul>
						<li>Automated Testing Script Development: Utilized the internal cloud testing system, XMMP, at Megatronix to streamline logical workflows based on case scenarios. Employed Python to script automated test cases, execute them, and subsequently analyze the results. Methodically recorded testing issues and tracked bugs, successfully replicating multiple system stability concerns. This facilitated targeted vulnerability patches.</li>
						<li>Upgrading in-vehicle infotainment systems: Upgraded systems based on the actual conditions of the infotainment systems, involving OTA upgrades for the Qualcomm 8155 in-vehicle chip and MCU, Fastboot flashing for the Qualcomm 8155 in-vehicle chip, as well as QFIL and PCAT flashing for the Qualcomm 8155 in-vehicle chip. Developed a Python script to invoke OTA commands, enhancing development efficiency. Developed scripts for analyzing key words in the QNX end system logs and for OTA upgrading of the in-car infotainment system version, resulting in improved work efficiency.</li>
						<li>Preliminary car system log analysis: Real vehicle testing or setting up a test environment to discover bugs in the car system, such as dual black screen. Depending on the situation, extract logs using ADB export command, pull QNX and Android log files into a document, or export logs through USB drive. Then submit to Jira for initial log analysis and further investigation by system stability engineers. Use PCAN-View to send messages to MCU, such as permanent stop of heartbeat or entering 9008 mode. Afterwards, use QPST tool to capture RAMDUMP data or upgrade the car system with QFIL. Improve efficiency of analyzing and locating log information through preliminary analysis.</li>
						<li>Code Optimization: Resolved the issue of duplicate log messages generated by the EcuUpdate module during the MCU upgrade process in OTA.</li>
				</ul>
